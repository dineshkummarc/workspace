  # The priority is based upon order of creation:
  # first created -> highest priority.

  # Sample of regular route:
  #   match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  # Sample of named route:
  #   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase
  # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Sample resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get :short
  #       post :toggle
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get :sold
  #     end
  #   end

  # Sample resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Sample resource route with more complex sub-resources
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get :recent, :on => :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Sample resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end

  namespace :sys do
    resources :countries, :languages, :regions, :currencies, :units, :companies, :index do
      # get :page, :on => :collection
      # post :delete_all, :on => :collection
      collection do
        get :page
        post :delete_all
      end
    end

    resources :menus do
      get :tree, :on => :collection
      post :delete_all, :on => :collection
    end
  end

  namespace :scm do
    resources :sales do
      collection do
        post :apply
        post :audit
        post :back
      end
    end
  end

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # just remember to delete public/index.html.
  root :to => "welcome#index"

  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"

  # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
  # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
  match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))'
